# Industrial-Organization-Berry-PhD

This repository contains materials for an assignment completed as part of a PhD-level Industrial Organization course. The assignment, designed by the course professor, focuses on replicating Table 1 from Steven T. Berry's seminal paper, _"Estimating Discrete-Choice Models of Product Differentiation,"_ published in the RAND Journal of Economics (Vol. 25, No. 2, 1994). Additionally, it includes an extension to a nested logit specification. The repository includes the following files:

1. **Berry_Question.pdf**: Contains the assignment details, including the replication task and the extension to the nested logit specification.
2. **Berry_logit.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook for replicating the logit model (Table 1 of Berry (1994)).
3. **Berry_nested_logit.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook that extends the analysis to the nested logit specification.
4. **Berry_report.pdf**: The main submission file, providing detailed explanations and presenting the results.
5. **berry.bib**: A BibTeX file containing bibliographical references used in the report.
6. **berry_submission.tex**: The LaTeX file used to generate the report PDF.
